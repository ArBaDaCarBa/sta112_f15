Create an interactive scatterplot of two numerical variables in the `diamonds`
dataset. The variables should be able to be selected from a drop down menu.

Then, add functionality to add a categorical variable to color the points with.
This variable should also be able to be selected from a drop down menu.

#### Tips

- First make a static version of a plot so that you develop the `ggplot2` code. Then
build the app.

- Feel free to use whatever code from the class demo you find is useful / relevant:

### Accessing the data

Once the `ggplot2` package is loaded, you can load the dataset with

```{r eval=FALSE}
data(diamonds)
```

### Submission instructions

Your submission should be an R Markdown file in your team App Ex repo, in a folder 
called `AppEx_10`.
