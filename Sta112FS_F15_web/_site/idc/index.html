<p class="right"><img src="photos/regis_kopper.png" alt="Regis Kopper" /></p>

<p><strong>Speaker</strong>: Regis Kopper <br />
Director of Duke DiVE</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Anita Layton</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>  Immersive virtual environments have been used in many areas of knowledge
including psychology, engineering, training and education. In this talk
I will present the DiVE, Duke’s virtual reality laboratory. I will give
a brief introduction of Virtual Reality (VR), what it is capable of and
what is the state of the art in display technologies. I will then
present the Bass Connection project “The Digital Landscape”,  which we
have been developing for the past two years. The goal of this project is
to capture data from archaeological dig sites and create reconstructed 3D
models that can be interactively explored in an immersive virtual
environment. I will conclude by talking about challenges and
opportunities presented when working with truly interdisciplinary teams,
as is the case with Bass Connections projects.</p>

<p class="right"><img src="photos/beka_steorts.png" alt="Beka Steorts" /></p>

<p><strong>Speaker</strong>: Beka Steorts <br />
Assistant Professor of Statistical Science</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Applied statistics involves the integration of mathematical 
statistics, computer science, and domain knowledge about an area of 
application, such as neuroimaging, official statistics, the medical field, 
human rights violations, and others. My research focuses on answering 
fundamental questions in social processes and then building probabilistic 
models to understand such processes. Moreover, this can provide guidance and 
insight to better inform decision in public policy. This talk is in two parts. 
First, we define what applied statistics is in today’s world. Second, we 
discuss two applications, the Syrian civil war and predictive modeling using 
electronic health care data. For both applications, I will discuss the 
application, interesting social science questions, and current methods in the 
literature for approaching both problems.</p>

<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Jesse Windle <br />
Director of Data Science at Hi Fidelity Genetics</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> I used to be a visiting assistant professor at Duke; now, I am the
first employee at an ag-based startup. In this talk I will tell you about my
transition to the “real world” and how Hi Fidelity Genetics is trying to make
sure there is enough food for an increasingly populous and prosperous world.</p>

<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Colin Rundel <br />
Assistant Professor of the Practice of Statistical Science</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this talk I will discuss Gaussian processes as a general 
regression-like modeling approach. This will include a review of common 
regression methodologies as well as an introduction to Gaussian process 
based approaches and how they generalize. We’ll wrap up with an example 
using Gaussian processes to model air pollution.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Anita Layton</p>

<p class="right"><img src="photos/nimmi_ramanujam.png" alt="Nimmi Ramanujam" /></p>

<p><strong>Speaker</strong>: Nimmi Ramanujam <br />
Professor of Biomedical Engineering</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Optical technologies have been exploited widely in the analytical
chemical analysis of biological samples. While the benefits of optical
spectroscopy and microscopy have long been known in the laboratory, over
the past quarter century there has been increasing interest in the
application of these techniques to intact human tissues. One of the
distinct attributes of light is that is provides exquisite chemical
specificity by interacting with a number of molecules that are already
present in the tissue and thus has the capability to provide insight
into functional, morphological and molecular contrast. Our objective is
to exploit the wealth of physiological, metabolic, morphological and
molecular sources of optical contrast to develop novel strategies that
focus on cervical cancer screening and breast cancer diagnostics.</p>

<p class="right"><img src="photos/paul_bendich.png" alt="Paul Bendich" /></p>

<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Paul Bendich <br />
Associate Director for Undergraduate Research at iiD</p>

<p>Want a first taste of research on a data science team, and get paid 5K
for doing so? The Data+ Program meets for ten weeks over the summer.
Students join small teams working on data-driven problems, often with a
connection to local companies or civic agencies.</p>

<p>Paul Bendich will talk about some of the great projects that happened
last summer (including work on political gerrymandering, hurricane
description via topology, and solar power work using image analysis and
machine-learning), and he will preview some of the possible teams for
next summer.</p>
