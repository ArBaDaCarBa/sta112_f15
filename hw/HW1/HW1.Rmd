## Instructions

1. There is a GitHub repo you have been invited to
    - located in the [organization](https://github.com/Sta112FS-Fall2015) for this class
    - name contains HW 1 and your name
    
Clone this repo in your local directory on `gort`. (Remember, the 
address is http://gort.stat.duke.edu:8787/.)

2. Edit the README.md to include some relevant information about the
repository, commit, and push. (This is just to check everything
is working fine, and you know what you're doing.)

3. Open a new R Markdown file, name it the same name as your repository,
and save it.

4. Include answers to all exercises in your R Markdown file. Your
answers should always include any summary and/or plot you use to answer
that particular question.

## Diamonds

The `diamonds` dataset that we will use in this application exercise 
consists of prices and quality information from about 54,000 diamonds, 
and is included in the `ggplot2` package. 

Since you already installed the `ggplot2` and `dplyr` libraries last 
time, you don't need to install them again. However each time you 
launch R you need to load the packages:

```{r message = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

To familiarize yourself with the dataset you can view the help file 
associated with it, or open up the dataset in the data viewer. To do
so, run the following commands in the Console.

```{r eval = FALSE}
?diamonds
View(diamonds)
```

Another function that you'll use very useful for quickly taking a peek 
at a dataset is `str`. This function compactly displays the internal 
**str**ucture of an R object.

```{r}
str(diamonds)
```

The output above tells us that there are 53,940 observations and 10 
variables in the dataset. The variable name are listed, along with 
their type and the first few observations of each variable. **Note:** R 
calls categorical variables `factor`s.

### More about the dataset

The dataset contains information on prices of diamonds, as well as 
various attributes of diamonds, some of which are known to influence 
their price (in 2008 $s): the 4 Cs (`carat`, `cut`, `color`, and 
`clarity`) , as well as some physical measurements (`depth`, `table`, 
`price`, `x`, `y`, and `z`). The figure below shows what these 
measurements represent.  

![diamond_measurements](diamond_measurements.png)

Carat is a unit of mass equal to 200 mg and is used for measuring 
gemstones and pearls. Cut grade is is an objective measure of a 
diamond's light performance, or, what we generally think of as sparkle.

The figures below shows color grading of diamonds:

### Exploring variables individually

In the next section we will explore and visualize the distributions of 
the variables in this dataset individual. This type of analysis is also 
called **univariate analysis**.

First we should say a few words about classifying variables:

- **Numerical variables** can be classified as **continuous** or 
**discrete** based on whether or not the variable can take on an 
infinite number of values or only non-negative whole numbers, 
respectively. 
- If the variable is **categorical**, we can determine if it is 
**ordinal** based on whether or not the levels have a natural ordering.

#### Exploring numerical data

When describing shapes of numerical distributions we highlight:

- shape:
    - right-skewed, left-skewed, symmetric (skew is to the side of the 
    longer tail)
    - unimodal, bimodal, multimodal, uniform
- center: mean (`mean`), median (`median`), mode (not always useful)
    - spead: range (`range`), standard deviation (`sd`), inter-quartile 
    range (`IQR`)
    - unusal observations

<div class="question">
**Exercise 1:** What type of variable is price? Would you expect its 
distribution to be symmetric, right-skewed, or left-skewed? Why?
</div>

<div class="question">
**Exercise 2:** Make a histogram of the distribution of diamond prices.
Does the shape of the distribution match your expectation?
Hint: Use `geom_histogram()`. See http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/geom_histogram.html for help.
</div>

Note that along with the plot, R printed out a warning for you:
```
stat_bin: binwidth defaulted to range/30. Use 'binwidth = x' to adjust 
this.
```

<div class="question">
**Exercise 3:** Try out a few other bin widths by adding the `binwidth` 
argument to the plot, until you find a bin width that's too narrow and 
one that is too wide to produce a meaningful histogram.**
</div>

Earlier we learned about **aesthetics** and **facets**, which were 
attributes mapped to certain variables in the dataset. Unlike these, 
the argment `binwidth` is simply a **parameter** input that controls 
the appearance of the graph, but does not map appearance to data. Most 
parameters come with a default value, and different geoms use different 
aesthetics and parameters.

<div class="question">
**Exercise 4:** Visualize the other numerical variables in the dataset 
and discuss any interesting features.**
</div>

When describing distributions of numerical variables we might also want 
to view statistics like mean, median, etc. (Functions for these are 
provided above, try a few.)
```{r eval = FALSE}
diamonds %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(price), sd = sd(price), median = median(price))
```

#### Exploring categorical data

We can also summarize `cut`s of diamonds. Since this is a categorical 
variable we use tables. To create the table, first group by the
**levels** of the cut variable, and then summarize the counts of
diamonds in each level.

- Frequency table:
```{r eval = FALSE}
diamonds %>%
  group_by(cut) %>%
  summarise(counts = n())
```

- Proportions table: Here we divide the counts in each level by
the number of rows (observations) in the diamonds variable:
```{r eval = FALSE}
diamonds %>%
  group_by(cut) %>%
  summarise(counts = n() / nrow(diamonds))
```

<div class="question">
**Exercise 5:** What type of variable is color? Are all colors of 
diamonds (shown in the figure above) represented in the dataset? Which
color is most prominently represented in the dataset?
</div>

A useful representation for categorical variables is a **bar plot**.

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = color)) +
  geom_bar()
```

<div class="question">
**Exercise 6:** Make a bar plot of the distribution of `cut`, and 
describe its distribution.
</div>

### Bivariate relationships

Now that we are familiar with the individual variables in the dataset, we can start evaluating relationships between them.

#### Adding another variable to a histogram

Let's make a histogram of the `depth`s of diamonds, with binwidth of 
0.2%, and adding another variable (say, `cut`) to the visualization.
We can do this either using an aesthetic or a facet:

- Using aesthetics: Use different colors to fill in for different cuts.
```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = depth, fill = cut)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2)
```

- Using facets: Split into different plots for different cuts.
```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = depth)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2) +
  facet_wrap(~ cut)
```

<div class="question">
**Exercise 7:** Typical diamonds of which cut have the highest depth? 
On average, does depth increase or decrease as cut grade increase or 
decrease?
</div>

<div class="question">
**Exercise 8:** Compare the distribution of price for the different 
cuts. Does anything seem unusual? Describe.
</div>

### More on plotting options

#### Position adjustments

Another parameter that can be passed to `qplot` is `position`. The options are 

* `position = "identity"`: Don't adjust position
* `position = "dodge"`: Adjust position by dodging overlaps to the side
* `position = "fill"`: Stack overlapping objects on top of one another, and standardise for comparable proportions across categories
* `position = "stack"`: Stack overlapping objects on top of one another
* `position = "jitter"`: Jitter points to avoid overplotting

<div class="question">
**Exercise 9:** First to recreate the following plot:
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3}
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = color, fill = cut)) +
  geom_bar()
```
and then add position definitions to the `geom_bar` (e.g.) 
`geom_bar(position = "dodge")` and describe what you see. Note that 
not all options will work for categorical variables.
</div>

Next, let's plot the relationship between price and carat for 
only diamonds with a `Fair` cut grading.

```{r eval=FALSE}
fair_diamonds <- diamonds %>%
  filter(cut == "Fair")
ggplot(data = fair_diamonds, aes(x = price, y = carat)) +
  geom_point()
ggplot(data = fair_diamonds, aes(x = price, y = carat)) +
  geom_point(position = "jitter")
```

<div class="question">
**Exercise 10:** Create a subset of diamonds that cost less than or 
equal to $1,000 (`<=`), and plot the relationship between price and 
carat with and without jittering. Do the plots look the same or 
different. What does this mean?
</div>

#### Zooming

You can also adjust the limits of your axes to zoom in on certain portions of the distribution.

Run the two following pieces of code to see how this option works:
```{r eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point()
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point() +
  ylim(0, 2000) +
  xlim(0, 1)
```

<div class="question">
**Exercise 11:** Describe the relationship between price and carat of
diamonds.
</div>

### Further exploration

<div class="question">
**Exercise 12:** Explore the distribution of carat. What can you see? 
What might explain that pattern? What carat weights are most common? 
Make sure to experiment with bin width!
</div>

<div class="question">
**Exercise 13:** Look again at the relationship between price and 
carat. What do the data clustered in vertical lines in the plot tell us?
</div>

<div class="question">
**Exercise 14:** Write down two questions that you could answer with 
these data, and use appropriate visualizations and summary statistics 
to answer them. Make sure at least one of these requires using multiple 
variables (through aesthetics and/or facets) at once. Be creative!
