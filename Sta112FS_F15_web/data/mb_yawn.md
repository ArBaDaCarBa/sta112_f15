Data from a 2005 MythBusters episode where the MythBusters team explored the question *Is yawning contagious?*

This data frame contains two variables (columns):

* `group` - which group subjects were assigned to (`treatment` or `control`)
* `outcome` - whether or not the subject yawned (`yawn` or `not yawn`)
