<p>The classes are designed to be as interactive as possible. My role as 
instructor is to introduce you new tools and techniques, but it is up 
to you to take them and make use of them. Programming is a skill that 
is best learned by doing, so as much as possible you will be working 
on a variety of tasks and activities throughout each class. Please 
bring your laptop to class every day.</p>

<h3 id="teams">Teams</h3>

<p>To construct functional and diverse teams, you will be asked to 
complete a short survey and to gauge your previous exposure to topics 
relevant to the course. After completing the survey, you will be 
assigned to teams of 3-5 students, and work in these teams during 
class and on the projects. The homework assignments and the take home 
final exam will be completed individually.</p>

<h3 id="projects">Projects</h3>

<p>Beyond the in class activities and homework assignments, you will be 
assigned larger computational tasks twice throughout the semester. 
These projects will be completed collaboratively by your team, and 
present your results to the class. Additional details on the project 
will be provided as the course progresses. All team members are 
expected to contribute equally to the completion of each assignment 
and you will be asked to evaluate your team members after each 
assignment is due.</p>

<p>Students are expected to make use of their team’s git repository on 
the course’s github page as their central collaborative platform. 
Commits to this repository will be used as a metric of each team 
member’s relative contribution for each homework.</p>

<h3 id="exam">Exam</h3>

<p>There will be a single take home final exam that you are expected to 
complete individually. It will ask you to complete a number of small 
computational tasks that cover the breadth of the material presented 
in the class.</p>

<h3 id="email--piazza">Email &amp; Piazza</h3>

<p>I will regularly send announcements by email, please make sure to 
check your email daily.</p>

<p>Any non-personal content-related questions should be posted on Piazza. 
Before posting a new question please make sure to check if your 
question has already been answered, and answer others’ questions.</p>

<h3 id="students-with-disabilities">Students with disabilities:</h3>

<p>Students with disabilities who believe they may need accommodations in this class 
are encouraged to contact the <a href="http://www.access.duke.edu/students/requesting/index.php">Student Disability Access Office</a> at (919) 668-1267 as soon as possible to 
better ensure that such accommodations can be made.</p>

<h3 id="academic-integrity">Academic integrity</h3>

<p>Duke University is a community dedicated to scholarship, leadership, and service 
and to the principles of honesty, fairness, respect, and accountability. Citizens 
of this community commit to reflect upon and uphold these principles in all 
academic and non-academic endeavors, and to protect and promote a culture of 
integrity. Cheating on exams and quizzes, plagiarism on homework assignments and 
projects, lying about an illness or absence and other forms of academic 
dishonesty are a breach of trust with classmates and faculty, violate the <a href="https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct/about-us/duke-
community-standard">Duke Community Standard</a>, and will not be tolerated. Such incidences will result in a 
0 grade for all parties involved as well as being reported to the <a href="http://www.studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct">Office of Student Conduct</a>. Additionally, there 
may be penalties to your final class grade. Please review the <a href="https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct/z-policies/academic-dishonesty">Duke’s Academic Dishonesty policies</a>.</p>

<p>A note on sharing / reusing code - I am well aware that a huge volume of 
code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. Unless I 
explicitly tell you not to use these resource the course’s policy is that 
you may make use of these resources (e.g. StackOverflow) but you must 
explicitly cite where the code was obtained from in your comments. Any 
recycled coded that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be 
treated as plagiarism. The one exception to this rule is that you may not 
directly share code with another team in this class, you are welcome to 
discuss the problems together and ask for advice, but you may not send or 
make use of code from another team.</p>

<h3 id="excused-absences">Excused absences</h3>

<p>Students who miss graded work due to a scheduled varsity trip, religious 
holiday or short-term illness should fill out an online 
<a href="https://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/athletic-varsity-participation">NOVAP</a>, 
<a href="https://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/religious-holidays">religious observance notification</a>, 
or <a href="http://trinity.duke.edu/academic-requirements?p=policy-short-term-illness-notification">short-term illness notification</a> 
form respectively.</p>

<p>If you cannot complete an assignment on the due date due to a short-term illness, 
you have <strong>until noon the following day</strong> to complete it at no penalty. Then the 
regular late work policy will kick in.</p>

<p>If you are faced with a personal or family emergency or a long-range or chronic 
health condition that interferes with your ability to attend or complete classes, 
you should contact your academic dean’s office. See more information on policies 
surrounding these conditions <a href="https://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/personal-emergencies">here</a>. 
Your academic dean can also provide more information.</p>
