# Wrap up one variable inference

## Rent in Durham {.smaller}

Data from a random sample of 20 1+ bedroom apartments in Durham in 2012.

```{r load-data}
durham_apts <- read.csv("https://stat.duke.edu/~mc301/data/durham_apts.csv")
```

## Exploratory analysis

```{r plot-data, fig.height=3, fig.width=5, message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = durham_apts, aes(x = rent)) +
  geom_dotplot()
durham_apts %>%
  summarise(xbar = mean(rent), med = median(rent))
```

## Bootstrap CI for mean rent in Durham

<div class="question">
Estimate the average rent in Durham for 1+ bedroom apartments using a 95% confidence interval.
</div>

```{r rent-mean-ci, fig.height=3, fig.width=5}
one_num_boot(durham_apts$rent, statistic = mean, seed = 195729)
```

## Bootstrap CI for median rent in Durham

<div class="question">
Estimate the median rent in Durham for 1+ bedroom apartments using a 95% confidence interval.
</div>

```{r rent-med-ci, fig.height=3, fig.width=5}
one_num_boot(durham_apts$rent, statistic = median, seed = 571035)
```

## Bootstrap testing for a mean

- Construct the bootstrap distribution

- Shift it to be centered at the null value

- Calculate the p-value as usual: observed or more extreme outcome (more extreme in the 
direction of the null hypothesis) given that the null value is true

## Bootstrap test for average rent in Durham

<div class="question">
Do these data provide convincing evidence that the average rent in Durham for 1+ bedroom
apartments is greater than $800?
</div>

```{r rent-mean-ht, fig.height=3, fig.width=5}
one_num_test(durham_apts$rent, statistic = mean, null = 800, alt = "greater", seed = 28732)
```

## Is yawning contagious?

An experiment conducted by the MythBusters tested if a person can be subconsciously influenced into yawning if another person near them yawns.

http://snagplayer.video.dp.discovery.com/614929/snag-it-player.htm?auto=no

## Study description

In this study 50 people were randomly assigned to two groups: 34 to a group where a person near them yawned (treatment) and 16 to a control group where they didn't see someone yawn (control).

```{r echo=FALSE}
mb_yawn <- read.csv("https://stat.duke.edu/~mc301/data/mb_yawn.csv")
```

```{r}
table(mb_yawn$group, mb_yawn$outcome)
```

## Proportion of yawners

```{r}
addmargins(table(mb_yawn$group, mb_yawn$outcome))
```

- Proportion of yawners in the treatment group: $\frac{10}{34} = 0.2941$

- Proportion of yawners in the control group: $\frac{4}{16} = 0.25$

- Our results match the ones calculated on the MythBusters episode.

<div class="question">
Based on the proportions we calculated, do you think yawning is really contagious, i.e. are 
seeing someone yawn and yawning dependent?
</div>

## Dependence, or another possible explanation?

- The observed differences might suggest that yawning is contagious, i.e. seeing someone yawn 
and yawning are dependent.

- But the differences are small enough that we might wonder if they might simple be **due to 
chance**.

- Perhaps if we were to repeat the experiment, we would see slightly different results.

- So we will do just that - well, somewhat - and see what happens.

- Instead of actually conducting the experiment many times, we will \hl{simulate} our results.

## Two competing claims

- ``There is nothing going on." 
Yawning and seeing someone yawn are **independent**, yawning is not contagious, observed difference in proportions is simply due to chance. $\rightarrow$ Null hypothesis

- ``There is something going on."
Yawning and seeing someone yawn are **dependent**, yawning is contagious, observed difference in proportions is not due to chance. $\rightarrow$ Alternative hypothesis

## Simulation setup

1. A regular deck of cards is comprised of 52 cards: 4 aces, 4 of numbers 2-10, 4 jacks, 4 queens, and 4 kings.

2. Take out two aces from the deck of cards and set them aside.

3. The remaining 50 playing cards to represent each participant in the study:
    - 14 face cards (including the 2 aces) represent the people who yawn.
    - 36 non-face cards represent the people who don't yawn.

## Running the simulation

1. Shuffle the 50 cards at least 7 times* to ensure that the cards counted out are from a random process.

2. Count out the top 16 cards and set them aside. These cards represent the people in the control group.

3. Out of the remaining 34 cards (treatment group) count the \red{number of face cards} (the number of people who yawned in the treatment group).

4. Calculate the difference in proportions of yawners (treatment - control), and plot it 
on the board.

5. Mark the difference you find on the dot plot.

## Checking for independence

<div class="question">
Do the simulation results suggest that yawning is contagious, i.e. does seeing someone yawn 
and yawning appear to be dependent?
</div>

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align='center',fig.width=7, fig.height=3}
load(url("https://stat.duke.edu/~mc301/R/fun/inference.RData"))
inference(y = outcome, x = group, data = mb_yawn, statistic = "proportion",
          type = "ht", null = 0, alternative = "greater", method = "simulation",
          success = "yawn", order = c("treatment", "control"), show_eda_plot = FALSE)
```
