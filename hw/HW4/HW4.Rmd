## Instructions

1. Start with your repo for this assignment
    - located at [organization](https://github.com/Sta112FS-Fall2015) for this class
    - name contains HW 4 and your name
    
Clone this repo in your local directory on `gort`. (Remember, the 
address is http://gort.stat.duke.edu:8787/.)

2. Edit the README.md to include some relevant information about the
repository, commit, and push. (This is just to check everything
is working fine, and you know what you're doing.)

3. Open a new R Markdown file, name it the same name as your repository,
and save it.

4. Include answers to all exercises in your R Markdown file. Your
answers should always include any summary and/or plot you use to answer
that particular question.

## Tasks

### Part 1: Harvest data

Use the `rvest` package to grab data (at a minimum) from the last fieve seasons of
the Duke basketball team. Starter code at XXX. We'll start with this in class,
with the 2014-2015 season. The data for this season is at http://goduke.statsgeek.com/basketball-m/seasons/season-stats.php?season=2014-15.

**Tips\:** 

- Do it for one season first, then think about automating it over the other
seasons (i.e. pages).
- Note that you will need to add an additional field to what is on the HTML
table that identifies the season.


### Part 2: Create an interactive visualization of the data

Use the `shiny` package to create an interactive visualization of these data. Minimum
requirements are drop down menus to choose variables.

### Other helpful packages

Other helpful packages are `ggplot2` and `dplyr` as usual, as well as `stringr` and
`lubridate`. You can, of course, use any pakcages that you want, but these might be 
sufficient.
