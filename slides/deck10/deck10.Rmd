# Today's agenda

## Today's agenda

- Modeling recap
    - Focus on interpreting slopes in multiple regression models
   
- Continue App Ex 5: Forward selection (finish in class)

- [Time permitting] Review App Ex 5

- **Due Thursday:**
    - Start midterm project -- at a minimum load data and start reviewing codebook
    - Review peer evaluations and schedule a time to meet with me as a team (details
    will be emailed)

# Modeling recap

## Parameter interpretation

- Slope:
    - Categorical vs. numerical explanatory variable: change vs. difference
    - Simple vs. multiple linear regression: "all else held constant"

- Intercept:
    - May be an extrapolation
    - May not be meaningful in context of the data
    
## Model fit

- $R^2$: % of variability in %y% explained by the model

- Adjusted $R^2$: used for model selection
    - Adjusted for sample size and number of explanatory variables
    
## Model selection

- Backwards: start with full model, take one variable at a time and 
maximize adjusted $R^2$

- Forwards: start with the single variable yielding the highest adjusted
$R^2$, add one variable at a time and maximize adjusted $R^2$

- If interaction is included, main effects must be included as well
    
# App Ex

## Continue App Ex 5

- Same task/set of variables as before, do forward selection instead

- 15 mins/team visit with me
